# Open-Data-Pathway

Overview

The details of this allocator pathway were initially described in an application to the Fil+ Governance Team in December 2023: [LINK](https://github.com/filecoin-project/notary-governance/issues/996). 

Below is an overview of the key client requirements and processes that the Filecoin Incentive Design Lab (FIDL) team will follow to oversee proper due diligence while insuring compliance to Fil+ guidelines for DataCap allocations.

Current Scope: 
Any client looking to onboard an open, public dataset to Filecoin can apply to this allocator pathway. 

Minimum requirements:
- At least two sealed copies of a dataset, stored with two separate Storage Provider Entities, in different regional locations.
- The dataset is made readily retrievable (via unsealed copy) on the network and can be regularly verified (through the use of manual or automated verification that includes retrieving data from various SPs over the course of the DataCap allocation timeframe).

Client requirements: 
Clients are required to apply for DataCap using the following GitHub repo LINK (coming soon) which contains questions related to the client role, data preparation, financing, dataset details, and storage provider distribution plan

Diligence on clients includes:
New User Check
Is this a completely new GitHub ID? (less than 2 months old)
Is this the first time this GitHub ID has applied for DataCap in this or other allocotor pathways?
If yes to either, applicants will have a maximum DataCap allowance for their first application (see below)

Client Check (KYC)
All applicants will be asked if they are willing to complete a free know your customer (KYC) check to confirm themself as a human user (see detailed below)
If they decline the check, they will be significantly limited in the maximum amount of DataCap they can request unless they are able to provide other forms of client identification.
